{
  "adjacency_matrix": "A bucket aggregation returning a form of adjacency matrix. The request\nprovides a collection of named filter expressions, similar to the filters\naggregation request.",
  "children": "A special single bucket aggregation that selects child documents that\nhave the specified type, as defined in a join field.",
  "composite": "A multi-bucket aggregation that creates composite buckets from different\nsources.",
  "date_histogram": "This multi-bucket aggregation is similar to the normal histogram, but it\ncan only be used with date values. Because dates are represented\ninternally in Elasticsearch as long values, it is possible, but not as\naccurate, to use the normal histogram on dates as well.",
  "date_range": "A range aggregation that is dedicated for date values. The main\ndifference between this aggregation and the normal range aggregation is\nthat the from and to values can be expressed in Date Math expressions,\nand it is also possible to specify a date format by which the from and to\nresponse fields will be returned.",
  "diversified_sampler": "Like the sampler aggregation this is a filtering aggregation used to\nlimit any sub aggregations' processing to a sample of the top-scoring\ndocuments. The diversified_sampler aggregation adds the ability to limit\nthe number of matches that share a common value such as an \"author\".",
  "filter": "Defines a single bucket of all the documents in the current document set\ncontext that match a specified filter. Often this will be used to narrow\ndown the current aggregation context to a specific set of documents.",
  "filters": "Defines a multi bucket aggregation where each bucket is associated with a\nfilter. Each bucket will collect all documents that match its associated\nfilter.",
  "geo_distance": "A multi-bucket aggregation that works on geo_point fields and\nconceptually works very similar to the range aggregation. The user can\ndefine a point of origin and a set of distance range buckets.",
  "geohash_grid": "A multi-bucket aggregation that works on geo_point fields and groups\npoints into buckets that represent cells in a grid. The resulting grid\ncan be sparse and only contains cells that have matching data.",
  "global": "Defines a single bucket of all the documents within the search execution\ncontext. This context is defined by the indices and the document types\nyou’re searching on, but is not influenced by the search query itself.",
  "histogram": "A multi-bucket values source based aggregation that can be applied on\nnumeric values extracted from the documents.",
  "ip_ranges": "A dedicated range aggregation for IP typed fields.",
  "missing": "A field data based single bucket aggregation, that creates a bucket of\nall documents in the current document set context that are missing a\nfield value (effectively, missing a field or having the configured NULL\nvalue set).",
  "nested": "A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating nested\ndocuments.",
  "range": "A multi-bucket value source based aggregation that enables the user to\ndefine a set of ranges - each representing a bucket.",
  "reverse_nested": "A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating on parent\ndocs from nested documents. Effectively this aggregation can break out of\nthe nested block structure and link to other nested structures or the\nroot document, which allows nesting other aggregations that aren’t part\nof the nested object in a nested aggregation.",
  "sampler": "A filtering aggregation used to limit any sub aggregations' processing to\na sample of the top-scoring documents.",
  "significant_terms": "An aggregation that returns interesting or unusual occurrences of terms\nin a set.",
  "significant_text": "An aggregation that returns interesting or unusual occurrences of\nfree-text terms in a set.",
  "terms": "A multi-bucket value source based aggregation where buckets are\ndynamically built - one per unique value.",
  "avg": "Computes the average of numeric values that are extracted from the\naggregated documents.",
  "boxplot": "Computes boxplot of numeric values extracted from the aggregated\ndocuments.",
  "cardinality": "Calculates an approximate count of distinct values.",
  "extended_stats": "Computes stats over numeric values extracted from the aggregated\ndocuments.",
  "geo_bounds": "Computes the bounding box containing all geo values for a field.",
  "geo_centroid": "Computes the weighted centroid from all coordinate values for geo fields.",
  "max": "Returns the maximum value among the numeric values extracted from the\naggregated documents.",
  "min": "Returns the minimum value among numeric values extracted from the\naggregated documents.",
  "percentile_ranks": "Calculates one or more percentile ranks over numeric values extracted\nfrom the aggregated documents.",
  "percentiles": "Calculates one or more percentiles over numeric values extracted from the\naggregated documents.",
  "scripted_metric": "A metric aggregation that executes using scripts to provide a metric\noutput.",
  "stats": "Computes stats over numeric values extracted from the aggregated\ndocuments.",
  "string_stats": "Computes statistics over string values extracted from the aggregated\ndocuments.",
  "sum": "Sums up numeric values that are extracted from the aggregated documents.",
  "t_test": "Performs a statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic\nfollows a Student’s t-distribution under the null hypothesis on numeric\nvalues.",
  "top_hits": "Keeps track of the most relevant document being aggregated. This\naggregator is intended to be used as a sub aggregator, so that the top\nmatching documents can be aggregated per bucket.",
  "top_metrics": "Selects metrics from the document with the largest or smallest \"sort\"\nvalue.",
  "value_count": "Counts the number of values that are extracted from the aggregated\ndocuments.",
  "weighted_avg": "Computes the weighted average of numeric values that are extracted from\nthe aggregated documents."
